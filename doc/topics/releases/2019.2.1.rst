* `#51817 <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/51817>`_ Saltclass external pillar broken in 2019.2.0

TODO: are these actually fixed or it is better not to mention them?

* `#50265 <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/50265>`_ saltclass pillar not available to jinja ?

TODO: mention incompatible changes:

* `minion_id` removed in favor of `opts.id` or `grains.id`
* Class ordering that is compatible with reclass
